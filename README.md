# Laptop Price Predictor 
<hr>

## Introduction
<p>This project aims to predict laptop prices based on various features such as RAM, CPU, GPU, Screen Resolution, Brand, and more. Leveraging machine learning techniques, I have developed a predictive model that can assist users in estimating the cost of a laptop given its specifications.</p>

## Objective
<p>The primary goal of this project is to develop a robust machine learning model capable of predicting laptop prices based on key features. By leveraging relevant specifications such as RAM, CPU, GPU and other attributes, the model aims to provide users with accurate estimates of laptop costs.</p>

## Performance
<p>For regression I tried several methods like Linear Regression, Lasso, Ridge, Random Forest, Extra Trees, AdaBoost among which Random Forest Regression method gave best results with the R2 Score(Coefficient of Determination) of 0.887 and Mean Absolute Error(MAE) of 0.158</p>
